When using Docker extensively, the management of several different containers quickly becomes cumbersome.
Docker Compose is a tool that helps us overcome this problem and easily handle multiple containers at once.
In this tutorial, we’ll examine its main features and powerful mechanisms.
In short, Docker Compose works by applying many rules declared within a single docker-compose.yml configuration file.
These YAML rules, both human-readable and machine-optimized, provide an effective way to snapshot the whole project from ten-thousand feet in a few lines.
We can get dozens of configurations applied by Compose under the hood. This will save us the hassle of scripting them with Bash or something else.
In this file, we need to specify the version of the Compose file format, at least one service, and optionally volumes and networks.
For example, let’s take a dockerized web application consisting of a front end, a back end, and a database. We’d likely split these components into three images, and define them as three different services in the configuration.
